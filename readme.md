-----
### This setup assumes you already have a `zsh` shell with `oh-my-sh`. If you don't, head [here for instructions to install zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH), and [here for instructions to install oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#basic-installation)

### **Instructions**
------

#### 1. Install the powerlevel9k theme by following [the instructions here](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki/Install-Instructions#step-1-install-powerlevel9k)

#### 2. Copy the contents of [raz.zshrc](raz.zshrc) into the `.zshrc` file which can be found in your home directory (essentially same place you find your `.bashrc` file, in the days when you used the bash shell).

#### 3. Source your `.zshrc` file by running `source ~/.zshrc`

#### 4. Download the [patched font](Sauce-Code-Pro-Medium-Nerd-Font-Complete.ttf) and select it in `Preferences -> Profiles -> Text -> Font` on iterm.

#### 5. Download the [Solarized Dark Theme](Solarized-Dark-Mod.itermcolors) and import it into iterm, and then select it `Preferences -> Profiles -> Color -> Color Presets`.

### And that's it! You now have a relatively beautiful terminal :)
